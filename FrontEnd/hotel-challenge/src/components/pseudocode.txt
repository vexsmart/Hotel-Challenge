create multiple components with their given logic, and these components will
reference container with buttons wich will call the api, when clicked one of this buttons 
it will show a window inside a modal where, depending on the call , will have
a form for posting and putting data in the DataBase.

the properties of the form will be, 

if(API_TYPE == POST){
    an input with a number property(this will be the room number) check if room number already exists.
    an input property to set if it is located or free
}

if(API_TYPE == PUT){
    an input to change the status(only two options: LOCADO, LIVRE);
}

the Apicontroller must be a hub of links to to different fetch components.
